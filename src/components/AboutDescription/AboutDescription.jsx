                                        WP Standard’s About Us page is almost like a look book with a minimal amount of copy or details about its origin. Instead, the story is told through a video, imagery, and sparse copy that summons the idea of resilience, exploration, and embracing the essential.

                                        In a way, its About Us page is more of an “about the customer” page that casts shoppers as the exploring protagonists in its video before bringing it back to its promise as a company.

                                        It’s a departure from the copy-driven pages we covered above, but it works in the favour of WP Standard as a brand of few words, or for brands that want to say a lot by saying very little.
